## 🔬 Abstract

Maritime surveillance is crucial for national security, illegal shipping detection, and disaster response. Traditional detection techniques such as CFAR or threshold-based methods result in high false positives, especially in noisy SAR images. Deep learning models like Faster R-CNN and YOLO perform well on natural images but struggle with SAR's grayscale format and environmental noise.

To solve this, we propose a **custom-optimized Faster R-CNN framework** integrated with:
- Region of Interest (ROI) and corner detection,
- Feature extraction using ResNet50 + Feature Pyramid Networks (FPN),
- Weight mapping and entropy-based filtering,
- Swish & Tanh activation functions,
- Hyperparameter tuning using Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO).

*The architecture utilizes ResNet50 and FPN for multi-scale feature extraction, enhanced by weight mapping and corner-aware ROIs. Activations are refined using Swish + Tanh, and the final layer detects and classifies ships in SAR scenes.*
